## Introduction
Hosting from home is risky as your IP address is made public. CrownPi will help you host from home safely using OpenVPN.
You must have a NordVPN or AreaVPN account to use CrownPi.

## Usage

Raspberry Pi - Raspian Stretch Lite:

```sh
sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defunctec/CrownPi-Testnet/master/crownpiscript.sh" -O install.sh | bash && sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

## Installation Guide

1. You must have a new copy of "Raspian Stretch Lite" installed on a 16GB SD Card using win32DiskImager for example.
2. This script can be run from user or root.
3. Enable SSH connections and expand the file system using
```sh
sudo raspi-config
``` 
4. Reboot the Pi 
```sh
sudo reboot now
```
5. Now get the local IP address of the PI which starts with 192.168 and can be used for SSH
```sh
ifconfig
```
6. Once logged in via SSH, use this command to initiate the installation process
```sh
sudo wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defunctec/CrownPi-Testnet/master/crownpiscript.sh" -O install.sh | bash && sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
7. Installation is mostly automated but does require manual input at the end.
8. Once the script has installed the Crown client and setup the backend the script will ask you which VPN provider you use, NordVPN or VPNArea, please choose and follow the instructions.
9. Now the VPN is setup, use the crown.conf to enter VPN IP, genkey ect.
```sh
sudo nano /root/.crown/crown.conf
```
10. Start the Crown Client
```sh
sudo crownd
```
11. Goto your wallet, where the collateral is held.
	 Edit the node you would like to host.
	 Change the IP address to your new VPN IP address, Click Ok.
	 The node will remain online or drop off. If it drops try "start missing" one more time.
12. Back to the CrownPi
	 Check the masternode is synced with the CrownPi by typing
```sh
sudo crown-cli masternode status
```
